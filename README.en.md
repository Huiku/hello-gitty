# Hello Gitty 🐱

[![Windows CI](https://github.com/Bavoch/hello-gitty/actions/workflows/windows.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Bavoch/hello-gitty/actions/workflows/windows.yml)

[简体中文](README.md) | English

Hello Gitty is a Git management tool built for solo AI-driven developers.

When developing with AI, I rarely read code directly, so most IDE features are unnecessary for me. Most of the time I just want to manage Git, control versions, or undo changes — yet I have to open heavyweight VS Code just for that small Git panel in the sidebar. Juggling multiple projects also means multiple VS Code windows: memory-hungry and anything but elegant.

So I built Hello Gitty: a lightweight, standalone companion focused on Git management.

## Highlights

- **Built for AI development workflows** — use an OpenAI-compatible API or a local AI CLI to generate Conventional Commits messages and assist with merge conflicts
- **Unified multi-repo management** — project status, commit activity, and type distribution at a glance; switch and launch projects quickly
- **Built-in dev server management** — detects launch commands and ports for common project types, so dev servers are managed inside the app
- **Safe, controlled version operations** — browse local and remote history, and reset to any version after confirmation
- **Lightweight and unobtrusive** — Tauri 2 + native frontend, ~5–8 MB installer, always-on-top window and system tray
- **Privacy first** — Git operations run through your local git CLI; repository content stays on your machine by default
- **Adaptable interface** — dark/light themes, a collapsible and resizable persistent sidebar, and a filter for repositories with uncommitted changes

## Features

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Overview dashboard | KPI cards across all projects, one-year commit heatmap, project-type donut chart, filterable/searchable project cards with one-click server launch |
| Project sidebar | Open/clone/drag-and-drop repositories, auto-detected project icons and types, live status summaries (branch, ahead/behind, change counts) |
| Workspace panel | Conflicts/staged/changes in three groups, inline diff preview, per-file stage/discard (two-step confirm), one-click ignore-rule setup with auto-generated `.gitignore` candidates |
| Commit | Commits staged changes only → AI-generated commit message → commit; or stage everything in one click |
| AI integrations | OpenAI-compatible APIs plus local CLIs including Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Qwen Code, Ollama, Crush, and OpenCode |
| Push / Pull | Handles branches without an upstream automatically; silent background fetch keeps status fresh |
| AI conflict resolution | Conflict files are merged by AI (> 80 KB requires manual handling), then automatically `git add`-ed with the merge completed |
| History timeline | Combined local + remote commits; reset to any historical version with a confirmation dialog |
| Branches | Switch branches; remote branches automatically get local tracking branches |
| Run panel | Scans and detects launch commands and ports (npm/django/make/cargo/go…), start/stop inside the app, line-by-line logs, external-run detection and safe shutdown |
| In-app updates | Checks for new versions on startup (or manually in Settings → About & Update); download and install in one step, with signature verification |
| Window | Always-on-top toggle to stay visible while coding; closing hides to the system tray |

## Installation

### Download from Releases

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/Bavoch/hello-gitty/releases) to download the latest installer:

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `Hello.Gitty_<version>_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS Intel | `Hello.Gitty_<version>_x64.dmg` |
| Windows 10/11 (x64) | `Hello.Gitty_<version>_x64-setup.exe` |

Once installed, the app checks for updates on startup; you can also check manually under Settings → About & Update and download and install without leaving the app.

> The macOS package is not Apple-notarized yet. On first launch, you may need to right-click the app and choose Open, or allow it under System Settings → Privacy & Security.
>
> The Windows installer does not yet use a commercial code-signing certificate. If SmartScreen appears, verify that the installer came from this repository before choosing Run anyway.

### Build from source

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+ and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). On Windows, also install Microsoft C++ Build Tools and WebView2 per the [Tauri Windows prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/#windows).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bavoch/hello-gitty.git
cd hello-gitty
npm ci
npm run dev      # development mode (auto-reloads on save)
npm run build    # macOS: .dmg; Windows: NSIS setup.exe
```

## Getting Started

1. Open the app → "Select Repository" to pick any local project folder, or clone from a remote URL
2. "Settings" at the bottom of the sidebar → choose an OpenAI-compatible API or a local AI CLI; API mode needs an endpoint, key, and model, while CLI mode scans tools that are already installed and signed in
3. Review conflicts, staged, and unstaged changes in the workspace; click a file to preview its diff
4. Click "Commit" to generate or write a message, then "Push / Pull" to sync with the remote
5. In the "Run" panel, pick a detected launch command, watch the logs, and start/stop dev servers

## Privacy & Security

- Git operations run through your local `git` CLI; repository content stays on your machine by default.
- API mode sends relevant diffs, recent commit messages, or conflicted file contents to the configured AI endpoint. Local CLI mode passes the same type of content to the selected tool; whether it uploads data depends on that provider. Review the applicable privacy policy and data practices.
- The AI API key is stored only in the local config; the GitHub token is used to create remote repositories and push — never commit or share it publicly.
- Report security vulnerabilities privately via the [security policy](SECURITY.md); general issues and feature suggestions can go to [Issues](https://github.com/Bavoch/hello-gitty/issues) or email `hello@lumifold.top`.

## Tech Stack

- **Tauri 2** + Rust backend (system git CLI, ~5–8 MB installer)
- Native HTML/CSS/JS frontend, no bundler
- AI through OpenAI-compatible APIs (OpenAI / DeepSeek / local services) or local CLIs (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / Qwen / Ollama / Crush / OpenCode)

## Structure

```
src/                Frontend (static, no build step)
src-tauri/src/      Backend
  git.rs            git CLI wrapper + porcelain v2 parsing
  ai.rs             AI commit messages / conflict resolution
  runner.rs         Server process supervision / port probing
  process.rs        Cross-platform process spawning (suppresses console windows on Windows)
  config.rs         Settings persistence
  lib.rs            Tauri commands
```

## Project Status

> ⚠️ **This project is 100% AI-developed.**
>
> From architecture design to implementation, feature iteration, and bug fixes, everything is done by AI; humans only confirm requirements and accept results. This means:
>
> - The code may contain **potential bugs or uncovered edge cases**
> - Some features may lack **thorough real-world testing**
> - **Use with caution in production** and keep backups of important data
>
> That said, development continues. If you run into problems, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/Bavoch/hello-gitty/issues) — every piece of feedback makes this project better 🐱

## Known Limitations

- When generating commit messages, diffs over 60 KB are truncated before being sent to the AI
- Conflict files over 80 KB cannot be handled by AI and need manual resolution (the app will prompt)
- Remote credentials are delegated to the system git credential helper (macOS Keychain / Windows Credential Manager)
- Repository hooks are respected (`--no-verify` is never used)
